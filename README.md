Text Classification - Natural Language ProcessingÂ¶
Text classification also known as text tagging or text categorization is the process of categorizing text into organized groups. By using Natural Language Processing (NLP), text classifiers can automatically analyze text and then assign a set of pre-defined tags or categories based on its content.

This kernel aims to give a brief overview of performing text classification using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and Decision Tree Classifier. We will be using a dataset called "Economic news article tone and relevance" which consists of approximately 8000 news articles, which were tagged as relevant or not relevant to the US Economy. Our goal in this kernel is to explore the process of training and testing text classifiers for this dataset.
